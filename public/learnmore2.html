<h2>Security</h2>
<p class="lead">As counsellors, we know that confidentiality and security of your client's information is paramount.
That's why our systems work only over encrypted Internet links, and use industrial-grade login and
password protection features. You can control which of your staff have access to client information,
and, for your additional security, client names and details are stored encrypted on our database, so
that they cannot be identified outside <strong>your</strong> account.</p>
